# lists & tuples

This repository is based on my university's studies in python, more especifically about lists and tuples

The exercises written in this repository are based on the following videos:

- [LISTAS em PYTHON | Programação Dinâmica](https://youtu.be/Mjl1O9ANFrI?si=z2hgBXZpSpbq9r5v)
- [29 - Tuplas | Papa Thalyson](https://youtu.be/QgaWtxVUGK4?si=G2sWBdlDYzqYn-tQ)
